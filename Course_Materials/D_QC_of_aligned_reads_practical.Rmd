# Checking the quality of the aligned data

Once we have aligned our reads, it is then possible to run some additional
quality checks on our data. In the first instance we will just look at some
basic metrics such as the percentage of aligned reads and the duplication
rates. We can then use some more sophisticated methods to assess the integrity
of our RNA and genomic locations to which our reads are aligning. 

## 1. A quick look at the alignment metrics with `samtools`

We previously used the `samtools` package to sort and index our bam file.
`samtools` also includes some simple tools to generate alignment metrics. This
can be very handy for a quick first look at our alignment quality. The tool we
are going to use is called `flagstat`

The **Usage** is:

```
samtools flagstat <in.bam>
```

Where `<in.bam>` is the bam file we wish to QC.

### Exercise 1

> 1. Go to `Course_Materials/` directory using the command `cd` (change
>    directory).
> 2. Use the `samtools flagstat` command to generate alignment metrics for
>    the sorted bam file you created in the previous practical.
> 
> Q) What percentage of the reads have aligned to the genome?


## 2. More detailed metrics with Picard Tools

[**Picard Tools**](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) is a suite of
tools for analysing and manipulating sequencing data. It is maintained by the
Broad Institute and comprises 88 different tools for doing jobs such as
generating QC metrics, modifying bam files in various ways, or converting files
between different formats.

We are going to use three QC metrics tools to get a variety of different
important metrics.

Picard is java based programme and so to run a particular Picard tool the
general format for the command is:

```
java -jar picard.jar PicardToolName OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2...
```

* `picard.jar` is the **J**ava **AR**chive file that contains all the tools  
* `PicardToolName` is the name of the tools that you wish to use. 

This is then followed by a series of options/arguments for that particular
tool. Each tool has specific options and arguments and you can check these
most easily by going to the [Picard
website](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), or by using the `--help``
command:

```
java -jar picard.jar PicardToolName --help
```

### 2.1 Duplication metrics

The first tool we are going to use is the `MarkDuplicates` tools. This tool
actually performs two tasks. 

First Picard reads through the bam file and finds any duplicate reads - these
are reads with the same 5' position. For each group of duplicate reads, Picard
selects a "primary" read based on the base quality scores and then marks all
other reads in the group as "duplicates" by adding **1024** to the sam flag. 

Once the duplicate reads are marked, Picard then also generates a metrics file
that contains information about the duplication rate.

### Exercise 2.1

> 1. Run Picard's MarkDuplicates tool on the sorted bam file using the
>    following command:
> ```
> java -jar /home/sawle01/Software/picard_2.20.6/picard.jar MarkDuplicates \
>     INPUT=bam/MCL1.DL.sorted.bam \
>     OUTPUT=bam/MCL1.DL.mkdup.bam \
>     METRICS_FILE=bam/MCL1.DL.mkdup_metrics.txt \
>     CREATE_INDEX=true
> ```
>
> Q. What is the duplication rate for this bam file?

### 2.2 Alignment metrics

Next we will collect some detailed alignment metrics using the
`CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics` tool. In this case we need to provide an
input bam, the name of the output metrics file and the fasta reference.


### Exercise 2.2

> 1. Run Picard's `CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics` tool on the sorted bam 
>    providing the following options.
>     * INPUT - The sorted bam file
>     * OUTPUT - "bam/MCL1.DL.alignment_metrics.bam"
>     * REFERENCE_SEQUENCE - "references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa"
>
> Q. What is the mismatch rate? This is the fraction of bases in mapped reads
>    that do not match the base at that position in the reference genome. This
>    is a combination of the number of SNPs and sequencing errors.

### 2.3 RNA alignment metrics

The `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` tool produces metrics describing the distribution of
the reads across different genomics locations - intronic, exonic, intergenic,
UTR - and the distribution of bases within the transcripts.

The `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` requires four pieces of information to run:

1. The input bam file  
2. An file name for the output metrics file
3. A file containing gene annotations in format called RefFlat that is defined
   [here](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/gbdDescriptionsOld.html#RefFlat).
   This format can be generated from a gtf file. We've already generated this
   file for you at `references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.97.txt`  
4. A parameter for strand specificity. Strand specificity is factor of the
   library prep chemistry. There are three possible options:  
        a) Forward stranded library prep, i.e. the reads are on the
           transcription strand - FIRST_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND   
        b) Reverse stranded library prep, i.e. the reads are on the reverse
           strand - SECOND_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND  
        c) Unstranded library prep, i.e. the reads may be on either strand -
           NONE  
    With your own data you would need to find this information out from whoever has
    prepared the library. In this case our library prep is unstranded, so we will
    use `NONE`.

### Exercise 2.3

> 1. Run Picard's `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` tool on the sorted bam file providing
>    the following options:
>       * INPUT - The sorted bam file
>       * OUTPUT - "bam/MCL1.DL.RNA_metrics.txt"
>       * REF_FLAT - the RefFlat reference file
>       * STRAND - "NONE"
>
> The results of this analysis are best viewed graphically, we will do this in
> the next exercise.

## 3. Visualising QC results with MultiQC

[MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) is a tool for collating multiple QC results
files into a single report. It's use is simple, you just run the command
`multiqc` in the directory containing your metrics files.

### Exercise 3.1

> 1. Move into the bam directory and run multiqc: `multiqc .` - the `.`
>    specifies "the current directory".
> 2. Open the html report that was generated by multiqc and inspect the QC plots

### Exercise 3.2

> In the `metrics` directory you should find Picard metrics for all of the bam
> files.  
> 1. Run multiqc in the metrics directory.  
> 2. Open the html report that was generated by multiqc and inspect the QC plots 
>
> Q. Are there any bam files that look problematic?
