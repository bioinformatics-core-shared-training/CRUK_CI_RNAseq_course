**Exercise 3.1.1**

Create a directory named `QC`. Read `fastqc` help manual to run it for `FASTQ/SRR7889585.fastq.gz` and store the results at the newly created folder (`QC`). To speed it up, use 7 threads (which it will allow our machines to use 7 processors). You will get an html file as output; Open it with an internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc) and answer the following questions:

1) navigate to the fastq directory
  cd fastq/
  
2) check we have our fastq files here
  ls
  
3) run fastqc on one of our samples
  fastqc MCL1.DL.fastq.gz
  
4) open the html report in a browser and see if you can answer these questions.
  A) What is the read length?
  B) Does the quality score vary through the read length?
  C) How is the data's quality?
