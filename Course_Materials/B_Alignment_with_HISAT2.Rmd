# Mapping reads to a reference genome

Once we are happy with the data quality, we can start to analyse the data.
Usually, the first step into the analysis requires mapping the RNA-seq reads to
the genome. There are numerous tools we could use to perform short read
alignment and the choice should be made carefully according to the analysis
goals and requirements. For RNAseq gene expression analysis Hisat2 is a very
fast tool that has been shown to have a good performance on published
benchmarks. 

We are going to be aligning the reads from the fastq against the GRCm38 
reference genome from Ensembl. This can be obtained here:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-97/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz

## 1 Indexing the genome for Hisat2

Typically our genome reference will be in [FASTA
format](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=BlastHelp).
Before we can start mapping RNA-seq reads to the genome, we need to create an
index to the genome. This index allows HISAT2 to quickly search the genome for
possible mapping positions for each read. It is analagous to an index in a
book: if you what to find out where in the book a particular word occurs it is
quicker to look at the index than to search through the book page by page, then
you can jump straight to the correct page to find the exact line and position
of the word.

The command to index the genome for hisat2 is `hisat2-build`. 

Access the help page to find the basic usage an other options:

`hisat2-build --help`

The **Usage** is:

```
hisat2-build [options]* <reference_in> <ht2_index_base>
    reference_in            comma-separated list of files with ref sequences
    hisat2_index_base       write ht2 data to files with this dir/basename
```

This means that we have to use the command `hisat2-build` to run the programme
and then we need to provide the reference genome files `<reference_in>` and
a base name for the index files `<hisat2_index_base>`. HISAT2 is going to
generate a number of files for the index and their names will all start with
our 'basename'.

### Exercise 1

> 1. Go to `Course_Materials/` directory using the command `cd` (change
>    directory).
> 2. Use `ls` to list the contents of the directory.  
>    There should be a `references` directory.  This will contain various
>    reference materials that we will need throughout analysis, such as the
>    mouse genome and gene annotations.
> 3. Use `ls references` to list the contents of the `references` directory.   
>    There should be file called `Mus_musculus.GRCm38.chr1.fa`. This is the
>    reference genome sequence for chromosome 1 in FASTA format. We are just
>    going to work with chromosome 1 for this exercise as indexing the entire
>    genome would take too long.
>    You'll also notice a directory called `hisat_index`, this is the index for
>    the entire genome, which has already been generated. We'll be using this
>    later.
> 4. Make a directory called `hisat2_index_chr1` inside the `references`
>    directory.  This is where we will create our chr1 index.
> 5. To create the hisat2 index run the following command: 
> 
> `hisat2-build -p 7 references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.chr1.fa references/hisat2_index_chr1/grcm38`
>    
>    Here we are providing the fasta file
>    `references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.chr1.fa` for the `<reference_in>` and
>    setting the `<hisat2_index_base>` to
>    `references/hisat2_index_chr1/mmu.GRCm38`, so all the files will be created in
>    the directory `references/hisat2_index_chr1` and their names will start
>    with `mmu.GRCm38`.
> 
> A) Why do we use `-p 7`? Take a look at `hisat2-build` help.
> B) How many files are created? 


## 2 Align with Hisat2

To map the reads to the genome we need to run `hisat2`. 

We will need to provide the command with three pieces of information:  
* A fastq file containing our unaligned reads
* The path to the index files - we do this by just supplying the basename for
  the index as in the previous command
* A name for the output file

We should also instruct hisat2 how many threads (processors) it should use (these
machines have 8 processors, so we should let hisat2 use 7 of them, keeping 1 free).

Take a quick look to hisat2's description

`hisat2 --help`

The usage is:
```
Usage:
  hisat2 [options]* -x <ht2-idx> {-1 <m1> -2 <m2> | -U <r>} [-S <sam>]

      <ht2-idx>  Index filename prefix (minus trailing .X.ht2).
      <m1>       Files with #1 mates, paired with files in <m2>.
                 Could be gzip'ed (extension: .gz) or bzip2'ed (extension: .bz2).
      <m2>       Files with #2 mates, paired with files in <m1>.
                 Could be gzip'ed (extension: .gz) or bzip2'ed (extension: .bz2).
      <r>        Files with unpaired reads.
                 Could be gzip'ed (extension: .gz) or bzip2'ed (extension: .bz2).
      <sam>      File for SAM output (default: stdout)

      <m1>, <m2>, <r> can be comma-separated lists (no whitespace) and can be
      specified many times.  E.g. '-U file1.fq,file2.fq -U file3.fq'.
```

So we need to provide the path to the index after the `-x` flag, the path to
out fastq file after the `-U` flag (if we had paired end data we would have 2
fastq files and would use the -1 and -2 flags), and the name for the output
file after the `-S` flag.  The output file format is SAM, so the output
filename should end `.sam`.

There many additional options that allow us to tweak the parameters used in the
alignment. As a general rule, unless you really know what you are doing you 
should stick to the defaults.

### Exercise 2 

> 1. Identify the smallest file in the fastq directory. hint: use `ls -lS` to
>    list the files and sort by size
> 2. Create a directory called `bam` (BAM will be our final aligned file
>    format, but we have one more step after alignment to get there).
> 3. Use hisat2 to align the fastq file. Use the following parameters
>       * Index (the full genome this time) - `references/hisat_index/mmu.GRCm38`
>       * Fastq file - `fastq/MCL1.DL.fastq.gz`
>       * Output file - `bam/MCL1.DL.sam`
>       * Set the number of threads (number of processors to use) to 7 - check
>         the help page to find the appropriate flag
> 
> **Note**: when the command runs successfully, there will be no indication
> that it is doing anything except that the command prompt disappears and the
> terminal will appear *frozen* (this is a helpful feature of many unix/linux
> tools). The alignment take 5-10 minutes.

## 3 Convert the SAM output to BAM 

The output of hisat2 is a SAM file. This is the a standardized format for presenting
aligned sequence data. You can read details of the specifications here:

https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

Unfortunately, this is a plain text file and they tend to be very large. BAM
files are the binary (compressed) version of SAM files. They are much smaller
and can be indexed making them quicker to access and process.

We can transform from SAM to BAM using `samtools`. `samtools` is a toolkit that
provides a number of useful tools for working with SAM/BAM files. In this case
we will use the `view` command to transform the SAM file into a BAM file.

The general command is:

`samtools view -b my_sample.sam > my_sample.bam`

`view` is the tool for viewing a sam or bam file. It can take many arguments 
which can do things such as filter for particular read characteristics. 
Normally it outputs in SAM format so that the results can be read by a human,
in this case the `-b` flag tells it to output in BAM format.

After we have transformed the SAM file to a BAM file we will want to index it,
but first we should sort the file so that the reads are in order with regard
to chromosome number and position.

To sort the file the general command is:

`samtools sort my_sample.bam > my_sample.sorted.bam`

Finally, we can index with the `index` command.

`samtools index my_sample.sorted.bam`

This will create a new file called `my_sample.bam.bai` (**ba**m **i**ndex).

### Exercise 3

> 1. Transform your aligned SAM file in to a BAM file.
> 2. Sort the BAM file
> Sorting can take 5-10 minutes 
> 3. Index the sorted BAM file
