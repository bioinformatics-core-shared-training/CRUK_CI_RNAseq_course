## Introduction and data import

* Today differential expression analysis of RNASeq data, in R
* aligned using HISAT2
* Bam files **`data`** directory under the **`CourseMaterials`** 
* Instructions on obtaining these materials in supplementary section

## Counting

* Also need annotation file (gtf) so feature counts knows where all your genes,
  UTRs etc. are
* can get from UCSC or ENSEMBL, instructions in supplementary section

* lets look at gtf
* navigate, ls and get them to display post it note
* unzip gtf file

```
cd ~/CourseMaterials/data/counts
  
head Mus_musculus.GRCm38.80.gtf
```

* basic fC run

```
  featureCounts \
      -t exon \
      -g gene_id \
      --primary \
      -a Mus_musculus.GRCm38.80.gtf \
      -o MCL1_DJ.featureCounts \
      MCL1_DJ.bam
```
* **`-t exon`** - the **feature** type to count reads against, in this case exons 
* **`-g gene_id`** - the **attribute** type to summarise by - gene ID
* **`--primary`** - only count primary alignment

**`featureCounts`** has many additional options that can be used to alter the
ways in which it does the counting.

```
featureCounts --help
```

* -s strandedness, check library prep
* -C same chromosome, fusions and cancer

```
cat MCL1.DJ.featureCounts.summary
```
* number assigned to genes
* unassigned - ambiguous - more than one feature in same location
             - multimapping - non primary multimappers
             - no features - alignment in region with no feature

```
head MCL1.DJ.featureCounts
```
* starts with cmd to generate, useful
* describe cols
* genes in same order as gtf, even where no counts, join multiple samples
* feature counts can do this for us
* save time, chr 15
* ls in small_bams


## Run on mutliple BAMS

```
  featureCounts \
      -t exon \
      -g gene_id \
      --primary \
      -a small_bams/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.80.chr15.gtf  \
      -o GSE60450_Lactation.chr15.featureCounts \
      small_bams/MCL*.bam
```


```
head GSE60450_Lactation.chr15.featureCounts
```

* combined table with first cols the same and new counts cols

> ## Challenge {.challenge}

> 1. Redo the counting over the exons, rather than the genes. Use `featureCounts --help` to find the option you need to use. Make sure featureCounts outputs the results to a new file.
```
  featureCounts \
      -t exon \
      -g exon_id \
      --primary \
      -a small_bams/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.80.chr15.gtf  \
      -o GSE60450_Lactation.chr15.featureCounts \
      small_bams/MCL*.bam
```

* there are also options for what to do with overlapping reads on multiple exons in help

> 2. Redo the counting over genes, allowing for multimapping reads. Compare the results to our intial counts.
